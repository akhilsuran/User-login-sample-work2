User Registration Form 
Build a user registration form using Vue.js. Create components for:  
 
1. RegistrationForm Component: Design a form with fields for username, email,
password, and a submit button. 

2. UserProfile Component: Once a user registers successfully, display their profile
information with a welcome message. 

Implement routing using Vue Router: 
- Route 1: `/register` - Display the `RegistrationForm` component. 
- Route 2: `/profile` - Show the `UserProfile` component after successful registration
